1) Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions

   An Internet website typically consists of two main divisions: the front-end and the back-end. Let's discuss the working of each division:

Front-end:
The front-end refers to the part of a website that users interact with directly. It involves the design, layout, and presentation of the website's content. The technologies used for front-end development include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.
The process of front-end development usually involves the following steps:
a. Structure (HTML): HTML is used to define the structure and elements of web pages. It determines the layout, headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and other content elements on the website.
b. Styling (CSS): CSS is responsible for the visual presentation of the website. It allows developers to define colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and other stylistic aspects of the web page.
c. Interactivity (JavaScript): JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It enables the implementation of features such as form validation, animations, dynamic content loading, and user interactions.

The front-end division focuses on creating an engaging user interface (UI) and ensuring that the website is visually appealing, easy to navigate, and responsive across different devices and screen sizes.

Back-end:
The back-end of a website refers to the server-side programming and infrastructure that powers the website's functionality. It handles the processing of data, database management, and server-side operations. The back-end is responsible for managing the logic and data manipulation required for the website to function correctly.
The back-end development process involves the following elements:
a. Server-Side Programming: Languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, or Node.js are commonly used for back-end development. These languages allow developers to build the logic and functionality of the website, process user requests, and generate appropriate responses.
b. Database Management: Back-end development often involves working with databases to store, retrieve, and manage data. Popular database systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.
c. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): APIs enable communication and data exchange between different software systems. They allow the front-end of the website to interact with the back-end services and retrieve or send data.

The back-end division focuses on handling user requests, processing data, managing databases, and implementing business logic to provide the desired functionality and features of the website.

In summary, the front-end division deals with the user interface, design, and interactivity of a website, while the back-end division handles the server-side programming, database management, and overall functionality of the website. Both divisions work together to create a complete, functional, and user-friendly Internet website.

2) What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example.

In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), tags are used to define the structure and elements of a web page. Tags are enclosed within angle brackets (<>) and are typically written in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content of a tag is placed between the opening and closing tags. Each tag serves a specific purpose and provides meaning to the browser about how to render the content.

Open Tags:
An open tag, also called an opening tag, is used to mark the beginning of an HTML element. It consists of the tag name enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and is followed by optional attributes that provide additional information about the element. The open tag is used to define the start of an element and is paired with a corresponding closing tag to encompass the content within that element.
Example of an open tag:<p>
In the above example, <p> is an open tag that marks the beginning of a paragraph element. It doesn't contain any attributes, but it denotes the start of the paragraph.

Closed Tags (Self-Closing Tags):
A closed tag, also known as a self-closing tag or void element, is used to define an HTML element that doesn't require additional content or nested elements. It consists of the tag name followed by a forward slash (/) and enclosed within angle brackets (<>) to indicate that it is a self-contained element.
Example of a closed tag:<br>
In the above example, <br> is a closed tag used to insert a line break in the content. It doesn't have a corresponding closing tag because it doesn't contain any content or nested elements.

3) Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM.

The Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a concept used in web development frameworks like React to optimize the rendering process and improve performance. The working procedure of the Virtual DOM can be explained in the following steps:

Initial Rendering:
When a web page or application is loaded or a component is first rendered, the Virtual DOM is created as an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. It is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.

Creating the Virtual DOM:
The Virtual DOM is created using JavaScript objects and maintains a hierarchical structure similar to the actual DOM. It includes elements, attributes, and text content of the web page.

Updating the Virtual DOM:
When there are changes to the data or state of the web page or component, the Virtual DOM is updated. This update can be triggered by user interactions, data updates, or any other event that modifies the content of the web page.

Reconciliation:
After the Virtual DOM is updated, a process called reconciliation takes place. React compares the previous Virtual DOM with the updated Virtual DOM to identify the differences or updates.

Diffing Algorithm:
React uses a diffing algorithm to efficiently determine the minimal number of changes needed to synchronize the actual DOM with the updated Virtual DOM. It analyzes the differences between the previous and updated Virtual DOMs.

Updating the Actual DOM:
Once the differences are identified, React applies only the necessary changes to the actual DOM, minimizing the direct interaction with the browser's rendering engine. This process is known as "reconciliation" or "diffing."

Efficient DOM Manipulation:
React optimizes the process of updating the actual DOM by batching multiple changes together. Instead of updating the DOM for each individual change, React performs a batch update, reducing the number of DOM manipulations and improving performance.

Rendering and Display:
After the necessary changes are applied to the actual DOM, the updated content is rendered and displayed on the user's screen. Users can interact with the web page or application, and any subsequent changes will trigger the process again from step 3.

By using the Virtual DOM, React minimizes the direct manipulation of the actual DOM, which can be an expensive operation. The Virtual DOM acts as a lightweight representation that allows React to efficiently track and update only the necessary parts of the actual DOM, resulting in improved performance and a smoother user experience.

4) Mention some Differences between MySQL and No SQL

   MySQL and NoSQL are two types of database management systems that differ in their data models, query languages, and use cases. Here are some key differences between MySQL and NoSQL databases:

Data Model:
MySQL: MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that follows a structured and predefined schema. It uses tables with rows and columns to store data, enforcing strict relationships between tables using foreign keys.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases, on the other hand, employ a flexible and schema-less data model. They can be categorized into different types, such as document databases (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g., Redis), columnar databases (e.g., Cassandra), or graph databases (e.g., Neo4j). Each NoSQL type has its own data model, such as documents, key-value pairs, column families, or graph structures.

Scalability:
MySQL: MySQL traditionally operates on a single server and uses vertical scaling, where hardware resources are upgraded to handle increased load. It can also be clustered or sharded to some extent to distribute the load across multiple servers. However, scaling MySQL can be complex and may have limitations in terms of scalability.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases are designed to handle massive amounts of data and high traffic loads. They are highly scalable and can be easily distributed across multiple servers, enabling horizontal scaling. NoSQL databases are built to support large-scale distributed systems and can handle the challenges of big data and high availability.

Query Language:
MySQL: MySQL uses SQL (Structured Query Language) as its query language. SQL is a powerful and widely adopted language for relational databases, offering a standardized way to query, manipulate, and manage data.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases typically have their own query languages or APIs specific to their data model. For example, MongoDB uses a flexible query language called MongoDB Query Language (MQL), which allows complex querying of documents. The query languages of NoSQL databases often differ from SQL and are tailored to the specific data model and use cases.

Schema Flexibility:
MySQL: In MySQL, the schema is predefined, and data must adhere to the predefined structure. Changes to the schema can be challenging and may require modifications to existing data.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases offer schema flexibility. They allow for dynamic and evolving data structures, where each record/document can have its own structure. This makes NoSQL databases well-suited for applications with evolving data requirements and flexible data models.

ACID Compliance:
MySQL: MySQL, as an RDBMS, provides ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. ACID compliance ensures data integrity, transactional consistency, and reliability.
NoSQL: NoSQL databases often prioritize scalability and performance over strict ACID compliance. They may sacrifice some ACID properties, such as strong consistency or immediate durability, in favor of higher scalability, availability, and performance. However, some NoSQL databases offer tunable consistency models and support for eventual consistency.

It's important to note that these differences are generalized, and specific features and capabilities can vary among different implementations of MySQL and NoSQL databases. The choice between MySQL and NoSQL depends on factors like data requirements, scalability needs, application characteristics, and development preferences.

5) Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words.

   One popular DBMS (Database Management System) technology is PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system known for its robustness, scalability, and extensive feature set. It is designed to handle large amounts of data and provide advanced functionalities for data management and analysis.

PostgreSQL also offers advanced indexing mechanisms like partial indexes, expression indexes, and even custom index types to cater to specific use cases.

In addition to its standard relational capabilities, PostgreSQL extends its functionality through the support of procedural languages and user-defined functions. It provides a wide range of procedural languages, including PL/pgSQL (PostgreSQL's own procedural language), PL/Python, PL/Perl, and more. These languages enable developers to write custom functions, triggers, and stored procedures directly in the database, enhancing data processing capabilities and facilitating complex data operations.

PostgreSQL also includes support for advanced transaction management and concurrency control. It ensures ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, allowing for reliable and consistent data transactions. PostgreSQL's concurrency control mechanisms, such as multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), enable high levels of concurrent access to the database, enhancing performance and scalability.

Furthermore, PostgreSQL provides features like table partitioning, replication, and high availability options to cater to the needs of demanding enterprise environments. It offers tools and extensions for data replication, load balancing, and failover, ensuring data availability and fault tolerance.

Overall, PostgreSQL is a powerful and feature-rich DBMS technology that combines the reliability and scalability of a relational database with advanced functionalities. Its open-source nature and active community contribute to its continuous development and improvement, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large-scale enterprise systems.
