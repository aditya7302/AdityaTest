1) Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions

   An Internet website typically consists of two main divisions: the front-end and the back-end. Let's discuss the working of each division:

Front-end:
The front-end refers to the part of a website that users interact with directly. It involves the design, layout, and presentation of the website's content. The technologies used for front-end development include HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.

Back-end:
The back-end of a website refers to the server-side programming and infrastructure that powers the website's functionality. It handles the processing of data, database management, and server-side operations. The back-end is responsible for managing the logic and data manipulation required for the website to function correctly.
